# Project Name: Separation Detection

## Description:
This project aims to develop a separation detection system that can accurately detect and track objects in a given environment. The system will utilize computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze video footage and identify instances where objects are separated or moved apart.

## Features:
- Real-time object detection and tracking
- Accurate separation detection
- User-friendly interface
- Customizable settings

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/separation-detection.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python main.py`

## Usage:
1. Launch the application.
2. Select the video file or live camera feed.
3. Adjust the detection settings if needed.
4. Click the "Start" button to begin the separation detection process.
5. Monitor the output for detected separations and their timestamps.
